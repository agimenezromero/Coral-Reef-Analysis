# Coral Reef Analysis

This repo contains the code used to analyze the Allen Coral Atlas database on shallow-water tropical reefs worldwide, used in the paper [].

The `Preprocessing` module is used to segment the original database in individual coral reefas, defined as independent no connected components.

The `Analysis`module is used to compute the different measures in each coral reef province (e.g. area-perimeter relation, inter-reef distance, fractal dimensions, etc)
