# Coral Reef Analysis

This repo contains the code used to analyze the Allen Coral Atlas database on shallow-water tropical reefs worldwide, used in the paper [].

- The `Preprocessing` module is used to segment the original database in individual coral reefas, defined as independent no connected components.

- The `Analysis` module is used to compute the different measures in each coral reef province (e.g. area-perimeter relation, inter-reef distance, fractal dimensions, etc)

- The final data product obtained with this code can be found at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10025083)
